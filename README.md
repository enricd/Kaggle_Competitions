# Kaggle_Competitions

Sometimes I haven't enough time to achieve a quite good and optimal solution and also part of my code, specially the starting point and baselines, may be from other users (I try to comment it but sorry if I missed it at some point). My main intention with Kaggle competitions is to learn and practice.
